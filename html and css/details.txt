âœ“ like this we call html entity and we can search 
    code for this on google.


when we notice that we are using smae style for all html
file in css then we can create onlye one p{
    style 
} then it will apply for all default .
example we are using font-family:arial; in all css so 
we can just write only once like p {
    font-family:arial; 
}....thats it
remember p belongs to p eliment so only p eliment will 
change not other.


whenever if our file is on folder so we have to name of folder
than file name like foldrname/filename.css


we can also link lots of font family like css file in our 
html file on Goole Fonts : <link rel="Preconnect" href="goolgle font link"
