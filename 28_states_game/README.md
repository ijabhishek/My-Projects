# India States Game

This Python script is an interactive game that allows users to guess and mark various states of India on a map. The game utilizes the `turtle` graphics module for creating a graphical user interface and the `pandas` library for data manipulation.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   - Make sure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas` and `turtle`).
   - Ensure that the CSV file `state_list.csv` contains the necessary state data.

2. **Running the Game:**
   - Execute the Python script in an environment with `turtle` support.
   - A window titled "India States Game" will appear.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - The game will display a map of India as the background.
   - An input prompt will ask for the name of a state.
   - Enter the name of a state and press Enter.
   - If the state is correct and hasn't been guessed before, it will be marked on the map.

4. **Objective:**
   - Continue guessing states until all 28 states of India are correctly identified.

5. **Notes:**
   - Ensure that the image file "india_map.gif" is in the same directory as the script, or provide the correct path if it's located elsewhere.

Have fun playing and learning about the states of India!
